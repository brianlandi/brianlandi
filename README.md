## Hi I'm Brian ðŸ‘‹

## About
I love writing code and coaching others in their process. I'm currently working as a Lead Engineer at a digital marketing agency.
I manage a team of web engineers, the codebase, and contribute on select projects. Iâ€™m also pretty quick on my feet with a homespun joke or pun.
